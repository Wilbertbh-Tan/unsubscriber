# Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 6/4/2024

Thank you for using our software that checks Gmail for spam emails. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your personal information and data when you use our software.

1. Information We Collect
OAuth Credentials: To access your Gmail account, we use OAuth credentials. These credentials allow our software to securely access your email data without storing your username and password.
Email Data: Our software accesses your Gmail account to read emails in your spam folder. This includes email subjects, sender addresses, and other metadata required to identify and manage spam emails.
2. How We Use Your Information
Email Analysis: The primary purpose of collecting email data is to identify and manage spam emails. The software reads your spam folder, lists email subjects and senders, and allows you to choose actions (block or subscribe) for each email.
No Data Storage: We do not store any of your email data or OAuth credentials on our servers. All data processing occurs locally on your machine.
3. Sharing Your Information
Third-Party Access: We do not share your personal information or email data with any third parties.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required by law or if we believe such action is necessary to comply with legal processes.
4. Data Security
We take data security seriously and implement measures to protect your information. This includes:

Secure Authentication: Using OAuth 2.0 for secure access to your Gmail account.
Local Processing: All data processing is done locally on your machine. We do not transmit your email data to any external servers.
5. User Control
You have full control over your email data:

Consent: By using the software, you consent to the processing of your email data as described in this Privacy Policy.
Revocation: You can revoke the software's access to your Gmail account at any time by removing the appâ€™s access in your Google Account settings.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Your continued use of the software after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
